## 📘 Overview

AskSmartAI is an educational app that enables users to ask questions via text or voice and receive intelligent responses powered by artificial intelligence. We value your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how your information is handled.

---

## 📲 Data We Collect

AskSmartAI **does not collect or store any personal data** from users.

However, to generate responses to user queries, the app:
- Sends the text of your question to our **private server**
- Our server may forward that text to a third-party AI service (OpenAI) to generate a response

No personal identifiers (such as name, email, IP address) are included in these requests.

---

## 🔄 Third-Party Services

To provide accurate and helpful answers, AskSmartAI relies on external AI services.

Specifically, we use:
- **OpenAI API** (a service of OpenAI, L.L.C.) to process user-submitted queries

All queries are routed through our private server (`https://hayataiapp.homes`), and only the **question text** is sent to OpenAI.  
No user-identifying data is included or stored by AskSmartAI or OpenAI.
